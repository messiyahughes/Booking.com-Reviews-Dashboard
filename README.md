# Booking.com Reviews Dashboard in Tableau

## Overview
This project demonstrates my ability to create insightful and interactive dashboards using Tableau Public. The **Booking.com Reviews Dashboard** provides a detailed analysis of user reviews, ratings, and overall guest satisfaction. By repurposing a dataset originally sourced from TripAdvisor, this project showcases how feedback data can be used to improve customer experiences and make data-driven decisions for the hotel industry.

## Key Features
- **Overall Rating Analysis**: Explore the average ratings across different hotels, identifying trends in guest satisfaction over time.
- **Hotel Category Breakdown**: Analyze ratings in key categories such as cleanliness, location, value for money, service quality, and overall guest experience.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: View how reviews are distributed between positive, neutral, and negative sentiments, providing insights into guest satisfaction.
- **Geographic Insights**: See how hotels perform in various regions or countries, helping businesses identify regional trends and competition.

## Dataset
- **Source**: [Tripadvisor Review Dataset by aayushs879 on GitHub](https://github.com/aayushs879/Tripadvisor-Review-dataset)
